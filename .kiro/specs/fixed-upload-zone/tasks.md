# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update Page component layout structure
  - Modify root container from `min-h-screen` to `h-screen` to prevent page scrolling
  - Add `overflow-hidden` to root container to contain all scrolling within components
  - Remove `justify-center` from main container and add `overflow-hidden`
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2. Restructure ClientWrapper component for fixed upload zone
  - Change container layout to vertical flex with full height (`flex flex-col h-full`)
  - Set maximum width constraint (`w-full max-w-2xl`)
  - Wrap UploadZone in flex-shrink-0 container to prevent compression
  - Create scrollable container for JobList with `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Optimize JobList component for scrollable container
  - Remove external margin-top from JobList container (handled by parent)
  - Ensure proper spacing between title and job items
  - Verify job items render correctly within scroll container
  - Test dynamic content addition/removal behavior
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Implement responsive design optimizations
  - Test layout behavior on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Ensure adequate scroll area on small screens
  - Verify upload zone remains accessible on mobile devices
  - Adjust spacing and sizing for optimal mobile experience
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Enhance scroll behavior and user experience
  - Add smooth scrolling behavior to job list container
  - Ensure proper scroll wheel and touch gesture handling
  - Test scroll performance with large number of jobs
  - Verify scroll position behavior when jobs are added/removed
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Test and validate the implementation
  - Verify upload zone remains visible during job list scrolling
  - Test job list scrolling independence from page scrolling
  - Validate responsive behavior across different devices
  - Ensure no regression in existing upload and job management functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
